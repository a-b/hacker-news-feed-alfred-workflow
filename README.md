# Hacker News Feed - An Alfred Workflow

Read [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/)? Use [Alfred v2](http://www.alfredapp.com/)? Got the Powerpack? Then this workflow is for you.

Once imported, simply launch Alfred, type ```hn``` and the submissions that are currently on the [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) homepage are right there in Alfred for you to browse with your keyboard. Simply use the up / down arrows to browse, then hit enter to view the submission. Easy.

The submissions feed comes from the unofficial Hacker News API developed by [Ronnie Roller](http://twitter.com/ronnieroller) for ihackernews.com. Details at: [http://api.ihackernews.com/](http://api.ihackernews.com/).
