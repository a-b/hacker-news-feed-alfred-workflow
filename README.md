# Hacker News Feed - a workflow for Alfred

This simple workflow pulls the submissions from the current Hacker News homepage and displays them in Alfred (via keyword "hn") for quick and easy viewing.

Developed by George Buckingham ([@gbuckingham89](http://twitter.com/gbuckingham89) | http://georgebuckingham.com).

To get the submissions, we use the unofficial Hacker News API developed by Ronnie Roller ([@ronnieroller](http://twitter.com/ronnieroller) | http://ronnieroller.com/ for ihackernews.com. Details at: http://api.ihackernews.com/.
